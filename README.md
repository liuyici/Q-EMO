This paper is currently under review by ECAI.

Quaternion Neural Networks (QNN) resource package needs to be downloaded here: https://github.com/Orkis-Research/Pytorch-Quaternion-Neural-Networks

#Datasets
You can find at: https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/seed.html and https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/seed-iv.html
After you download the qnn resource package and dataset, run the main.py file in the terminal.

If you have any question,
